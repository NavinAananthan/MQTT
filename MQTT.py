#This piece of code is running for a single topic Humidity
#The on_connect() callback is called each time the client connects/reconnects to the broker.
#We create the on_connect callback function. It takes 4 parameters: the client object, userdata, flags, rc.
#1.The client object.
#2.userdata is custom data declared in the client constructor. You will need this if you want to pass custom data into the callback.
#3.flags is a dictionary object that is used to check if you have set clean session to True or False for the client object.
#4.rc which is the result code, is used to check the connection status. The different result codes are

#The on_message() callback is used to process messages that are published to a subscribed topic.
#In our program, we need to do 3 things:
#1. Subscribe to the topic that we are publishing to.
#2. Process the published message using the callback. In our program, we will simply print the message.
#3. Assign the callback function to the on_message attribute of the client object.
#The actual message payload is a binary buffer. In order to decode this payload you need to know what type of data was sent
